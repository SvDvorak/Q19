- Enemy texture
- Enemy gibs model & texture
- Enemy blood sprite
- Firing slowmo post process color effect
- Speed streaks particle effect (at high speeds)
- Smaller laser, mostly at aimed target (hard to see what you're shooting at)
- Music, even if just ripped
- Transition limits speed (maybe no friction too?), each playthrough should be independent
- Higher energy max, try to make user "save up" on boosts, ie make boosting a strategic decision and not just a reaction as player gets more energy from kills.
- New level to test out speeds better, I want the lowest to stay the same but max speed should be lowered somehow. Maybe by having more friction at higher speeds. It should always be better to be going fast but there should be a reason to maybe time out your boosts better.
- A slight vignette on camera?
- Try adding breaking when turning, ie turning is "negative". Not sure this will be good though
- If publishing, an info screen on start
- Level timer is using physics update, possible to use render update instead? Limited to physics tickrate otherwise.

- Possible design change to test. Usually I want to use boost immediately after having stopped shooting, maybe make this automatic? Though gotta have a locked base speed to start from in that case.


DESIGN
------

Always going forward, never stop, never go backwards.
Accumulating speed instead of instant which requires skill. Movement path through level is important and requires some improvisation as your killing enemies at the same time.
Short levels, a continous loop of self improvement
Lovely Planet uses the word "Gun Ballet" which is a good description.

Similar/inspiration games:

- Quake Defrag
  Quake mod, levels based on strafe jumping, rocket jumping, etc to complete. Strafe jumping is an accumulating speed which requires skill.

- Perfect Stride 
  Great feeling movement, always going forward. A bit odd controls at first, turning to gain speed but not turning too fast. Kinda like racing. Movement requires skill.
    
- Devil Daggers
  Quake looking FPS, great visuals and great FPS controls
    
- Lovely Planet
  Levels are hard to complete, getting a great time is even harder. But in a good way, you don't have to do the super hard.

- High hell
  Cool artstyle, only one weapon and short levels (atleast the first few). BUT... cramped so you easily get stuck and not an apparent level path.

- DOOM (2016)
  Great feel and when you get into the groove you can really get into just going forward, blasting enemies along the way. And possibly doing laps in the same level to finish of missed enemies (I remember one specific part later on in the game).

- Get To The Orange Door demo
  Super fluid movement while also being quite forgiving. This is kinda the opposite of my design similar to racing which is making me reconsider the very forced line similar to Perfect Stride. You can do two things at the same time it seems, like reloading while kicking. Gave me an idea of how you can air kick or ground kick, what if each has a cooldown so you have to swap. Forcing you to shoot until you reload, use both kicks and then hopefully reload is done. This game has much more improvisation... which feels good when you react well. But there was also an aimlessness to the demo. Wondering if both can be combined, have a plan with a path but encourage improvisation during execution. I should buy it, demo seems to be old and a bit different?

- FOTONICA
  A bit too dissimilar, it's got the speed and shows it very nicely. The most similarities come to how to present speed and feedback on interaction. The camera wobble together with hands when jumping and landing is very nice. The game has multiple paths than you can weave between so missing one doesn't mean failure... and making such a mistake also forces you to improvise much more.

- Frost Runner
  Bad music, breathing character is annoying, UI is ugly, standard FPS controls. But hey, it works, feels a bit cookie cutter here at the start. Hand animation is a bit clunky and visibly repeating each jump. Ice movement has similarities to my movement but with less control. Good use of particles for the feeling of speed. Uses FOV change also, smart. Felt like it kept introducing new mechanics to keep it interesting instead of doing something with the ones it already had. Idea was probably to have different worlds but felt a bit shallow in practice.

- Neon Boost
  Rocket jumping, yay! Doesn't feel as good as quake, booo! Movement doesn't feel perfect but might have to do with the feedback, weapon jerks weirdly when jumping or landing and with no camera feedback. Just doesn't feel tight (yeah, that's a bit bullshit). Otherwise standard FPS controls. The neon is a bit extreme but I guess that is the style.

- Cloudbuilt
  Jerky animations, when going from wall run to ledge grab. Hard to even see a transition, kinda just instantly swaps. Barely any sounds? Works ok with the background music and swooshing I guess. Hanging when dropping feels like it slows you down. Seems like the tutorial does a bit of a disservice to the levels, too tight. Gotta say that they nailed the feeling of combining abilities one after another, every single one feel distinct and powerful it their own way. I think having it in 3rd person helps with feedback because you see the character animate as a response to actions. In first person that is trickier. Levels are very open ended. FOTONICA may have had a few paths, this is a sandbox in comparison. Story feels completely disconnected from gameplay though.

- SEUM
  Movement feels absolutely brilliant, great controls. Pretty funny intro that fits with the theme. Less improvisation and more about finding the optimal path and optimizing. Limited level movement. But allows for variation in timing in some levels based on fireball-shooters, activating platforms, moving spikes, etc.

- Bunny Hop League
  Damn it starts hard but the feeling when you start nailing bunny hopping... it just feels so good. Getting a perfect flow. But maybe a bit too binary on win/failure, here just getting through a level is very difficult. I want it to be somewhat tricky to get through but very hard to get a perfect run.

If doing bike style, somewhat similar games:
- Wave Break https://store.steampowered.com/app/761010/Wave_Break/   https://youtu.be/5sDoYrCcuPA
- Desert Child https://store.steampowered.com/app/844050/Desert_Child/
- https://store.steampowered.com/app/641910/Bike_Rush/ (shit game but similar with motorcycle and shooting)


---------------
Movement
---------------

Racing like
Forward accelerates, slower turn when higher speed, locks turn amount. For example can turn 60 degrees/second when standing still but at full speed can only turn 30 degrees/second.
Does not feel good, very locked in when hitting edges of turnspeed.

Camera lock & boost forward
Spacebar does single frame boost, camera follows mouse ie no limit on turning. Friction slows player down so must boost intermittently.
Feels much better, can go pretty fast where the limit is just the player. And this is without shooting & enemies!

+ Strafe boost
Added a strafe boost that adds pushes player to either side while still locking camera to forward movement. It works but it feels more complicated for a very small benefit, it's just easier to use camera to slalom around objects.

Boost direction
Spacebar still does single frame boost BUT camera does not follow mouse completely, boost can realign move direction but mouse just slowly turns. It works somewhat but you don't feel as much in control as when camera is locked. You can do some cool maneuvers like going around a corner in a parapolic arc while still looking at the corner (as movement tries to align with camera, creating the arc).

FNA version
---------------


Okidoki.
So I've cloned the FNA repo and copied over the Windows x86 library binaries it depends on (SDL2, Mojoshader, SDL2_Image, FAudio) so that when FNA is built it will pass on the libraries.
Which means, whenever you update FNA you *might* need to update these binaries as well.
